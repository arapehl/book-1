# Welcome

I want to try writing a book completely out in the open. I'll write it here, on GitHub, in this repo, making atomic commits in order to capture my thought process as I go.

Some caveats:
- The content here is the furthest thing from a polished product.
- It will change, sometimes drastically, as I work through the story.
- I have yet to find a decent spell checker for VSCode (that handles Canadian English), so for now, I'm going without one. Let's see how well I do.
  
 The best way to keep up with edits is to keep an eye on the repo's [commit history](https://github.com/arapehl/book-1/commits/trunk). Feel free to leave comments. I'd love your feedback.
