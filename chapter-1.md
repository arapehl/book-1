# Chapter 1

It was getting late. The grandkids, who only an hour ago were running laps around the coffee table were now quiet. Three year-old Maddie, still grasping the ear of her favourite stuffed bunny, was fast asleep on the living room couch—her blonde pigtails having barely survived the evening. Her older brother Michael, abandoning his puzzle, stood and turned to his mother with outstretched arms. She obliged and picked him up as he tilted his head back to accommodate an enormous yawn.

"I think it's time we called it a night," said Judy, eyeing her husband Ron as Michael snuggled in her lap.

*Ding*, came a sound from the kitchen.

"Yeah, if we don't hit the road soon, I'm gonna be next," said Ron, letting out a yawn of his own. "Man, these really are contagious."

"We can make up the guest room," came the customary offer. Monica Thorpe, always the consummate host, loved having her children and grandchildren over. Judy was her third and youngest daughter. They were over for Sunday dinner and though she knew that Judy and Ron would have to be at work in the morning, she could never pass up the opportunity to offer them her hospitality.

*Ding*

"They need to work tomorrow, honey," interjected her husband, Bill. "We all do." Grandparents though they were, they'd yet to retire. Monica was a small business owner in town. She'd owned and operated a successful antique shop for over thirty years. Her husband Bill, or the Honorable William J. Thorpe, had been a US Federal Judge for twenty-four years though his career in law spanned over twice that long.

*Ding*

"Honey, I think someone's messaging you." Bill's phone lay on the kitchen counter and could be heard dinging from the living room.

"I'll get to it in a minute," he replied. Seeing his grandkids off was more important than whatever messages awaited him on his phone.

Judy gently stood, careful not to disturb the now sleeping Michael snuggled in her arms. She walked to the door whispering to Ron, "can you get the door for me?" Ron, already standing walked ahead of her to the front door, opening it, and as Judy walked past, unlocking the car doors with his key fob. Judy shifted Michael's weight more toward her torso to free up a hand and deftly open a rear car door. She then placed Michael in his car seat, shushing him back to sleep as she buckled him in. Ron was on the other side of the car now performing the identical task with Maddie. She was deeper asleep and didn't fuss at all. Both parents would've been amused to know that they were both thinking how fortunate they were that it was summer, negating the need for the hassle of getting the kids into snow suits prior to putting them in the car.

Bill and Monica beamed from the front door as their grandkids were packed away into the sedan. "Excuse me," said Ron, slipping between the couple back into the house to pick up the diaper bag and kids' toys.

*Ding*

"Go check your phone, Bill."

"Ok, ok," he said, walking toward the car to give Judy a hug goodbye. "Drive safe," he said, holding his daughter. He then turned back toward the house, meeting Ron at the door. He shook Ron's hand with a smile, "drive safe," he said, and made his way to the kitchen to check his phone.

Monica walked with Ron to the car, taking the opportunity to see the sleeping kids one last time before they left. Her smile was as big as a proud grandmother's could be. She hugged her daughter and her son-in-law adding, "we'll see you soon?"

"I'll call you," said Judy, meaning they'd figure out who would visit whom and when. Monica smiled as her daughter buckled herself into the driver's seat and started the car. She watched as the car carefully backed out of the driveway, shifted into drive and after a flick of its high beams to say goodbye one last time, proceeded on its way. It occurred to Monica just then that Bill hadn't returned from the kitchen. She turned and walked back into the house calling, "Bill?"

"Bill?" She said, walking through the living room, toward the kitchen. She found her husband sitting at the kitchen table, staring at his phone, his face ashen. "Is everything okay, Bill?" She asked, a hint of concern in her voice.

Bill immediately locked the phone and said, "yeah," smiling.

The smile was forced, she could tell. She knew her husband and could tell when something was wrong. "You're sure?" She pushed gently.

"Yeah, yeah," he said, his gaze shifting. He took a deep breath and stood up. "It's a case. Something was just brought to my attention. It might affect my ruling on the Spencer trial. I'll have to look into it tomorrow." He surprised his wife a hug, whispering, "I love you." He let go and made his way to the living room. She heard him open the liquor cabinet. Something was up but she didn't want to pry. He'd tell her, in his time. He always did.

"I'm going to get ready for bed," she said, walking up the stairs.

"Ok, I'll be there in a bit," he replied, pouring himself a whisky.

Monica slowly made her way up the stairs and into the bathroom where she began here nightly ritual of removing her makeup and applying the various moisturizers and creams to her face to keep her looking ten years younger than her actual age. She heard her husband pull the cork off a bottle of whisky and pour what sounded like a double, or was that a triple? It sounded like a generous pour. Something was definitely up. He'd be down there for a while, sipping at his whisky, thinking through whatever case or problem it was that preoccupied his mind.

It was 2 AM when she heard her husband getting in bed. It always woke her when he came to bed late but she never said anything because he was always so careful to try and not make any noise. He'd always been a good husband, father, and now grandfather. 46 years of marriage, always so attentive, always present and willing to do whatever needed to be done to protect and provide for his family. That comforting thought, and the sense of her husband lying next to her lulled her back to sleep.

Bill wouldn't be so lucky. He lay on his back, staring at the ceiling, unable to tame his thoughts long enough to succumb to his fatigue. Forcing his eyes closed, he tried to distract himself by thinking of being on a fishing trip. Sitting on his boat out in the middle of the lake, the waves bobbing him up and down, sipping on a cold beer hoping nothing would bite at his line—it was working! He was falling asleep! And just like that, he was awake again. Frustrated. Staring at the ceiling. Back to the boat, the waves, the beer, the line... was he? Did he? Had he fallen asleep? He wasn't sure, but he knew he was awake now. *Damn it*, he thought. He turned on his side. He knew he shouldn't look at the clock but he couldn't help himself. How long had he been awake in bed? Had he fallen asleep? Was his alarm about to go off and wake him? 2:45 AM. *Forty five minutes since I got in bed.* Had he been awake all that time? He couldn't tell. Despite his best efforts, his mind couldn't relax. Always going back to those texts. Obsessing over their contents. *Fishing, boat, beer.* He tried to picture the slow lapping waves breaking on the side of the boat. The lazy day with nothing more important to do than very slowly work his way through the case of beer he'd brought on the boat and hopefully not have any fish to deal wi—*BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP*

*No. It couldn't be. Please no*. He turned his head. 6 AM. *How!?* He was exhausted. He hadn't slept. Or if he had, he hadn't rested at all. In fact, he felt more tired now than he had when he'd first crawled into bed four hours ago. *Four hours? You can't operate on four hours of sleep, Bill.* But he had to. He had to be in court at eight. Today would require a *lot* of coffee. He turned, his arm landing on the empty other half of the bed. His wife had gotten up before him and was likely well into her exercise routine.

***

His eyes were already open when his alarm went off; the smell of freshly brewed coffee having roused him from his slumber a few minutes prior. The heavenly scent didn't have far to travel in his small apartment, but it meant the kitchen was mercifully close, and so was his day's first cup of coffee.

*This isn't going to be a good day*, he thought as he sat himself up on the edge of his bed. He did the mental arithmetic, *six AM, four hours till ten.* He had to see the shrink today. He hated seeing the shrink. *Such a waste of time. What's she going to do, unextradite Spencer from the States?* He stood, the soles of his bare feet protesting the action as his weight settled on them. He inahled deeply as he padded to the kitchen, the fragrance emanating from his drip machine filling his lungs. The promise of coffee had an oddly calming effect. He grabbed a mug from the cabinet above the machine and poured a cup of black coffee. He'd long since gotten used to taking his coffee black. At first it was out of necessity, they never had cream or sugar at the office. And then he'd gotten used to it. The doctor said cutting the sugar out had been good for him. He shrugged and took his first sip. His eyes closed as the hot liquid brought life to his still waking body.

"Alexa, what's new?" he asked the dark room.

"Here's your news," came the response from the smart speaker in the living room. "From CBC News Montreal…" it continued. His gaze softened as the smart speaker played the latest local news. There was a story about residential schools. They were finding more bodies. *That's a pleasant way to start the day* he thought, and immediately rebuked himself. *They're kids, man. They suffered and died. Shut the fuck up and listen to the story.* He sipped at his coffee and let the gravity of the piece settle on his waking mind. The announcer moved on to discuss the upcoming Federal election. He let his mind wander as he walked over to the sliding doors which opened onto the balcony. From his fifth floor apartment faced the east, and the tall glass doors offered a spectacular view of the sun rising over the suburbs below. "From CNN News…" the speaker continued. He took another sip of his coffee. It wasn't piping hot anymore, which made it more pleasant to drink. *Spencer trial?* "Alexa, rewind fifteen seconds," he said. "Judge Thorpe is expected to announce his verdict in the trial of Marius Spencer." *Fuck. That's today?*
